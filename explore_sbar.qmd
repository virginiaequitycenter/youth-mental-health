The [Student Behavior and Administrative Response](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/data-reports/data-collection/student-behavior-and-administrative-response-collection) report represents the number of reported incidents of problematic student behavior that occurred on Virginia public school property, on a school bus, or at a school-sponsored activity for each school year. Participation is mandatory for public schools, and the report provides safety indicators for Virginia’s School Quality Profile.

Rates are calculated using the annual [fall enrollment](https://p1pe.doe.virginia.gov/apex_captcha/home.do?apexTypeId=304) counts from the Virginia Department of Education.

The SBAR data is aggregated by state, [region](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/about-vdoe/virginia-school-directories/virginia-public-school-listing-by-region), division/county, and school. It is available for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 school years.

## Data Components

According to our [PHI Data Components diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jfh1NoCpxkOeeoXxONXP2NGjU9_UwGUjncOE0TjsgIM/edit?usp=sharing), the following three indicators come from the SBAR data:

1.  The number of reported incidents of **bullying**

2.  The number of reported incidents that contribute to a **hostile or unsafe school environment**

3.  The number of reported **acts of violence**

These three groups are *mutually exclusive and custom curated*. More details on the categorization criteria are described in each section below.

### Behavior Codes

A list of all behavior codes can be found here: [SBAR Behavior Codes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3MbeIxVj7tKs50iHRmrGv77sPN6EMLXO2VU1IsEeXg/edit?usp=sharing)

## Bullying

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple" collapse="true}
## Bullying is an example of externalizing behavior at the school level.

![](explore_sbar_files/bullying.png)
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true"}
## There are 4 behavior codes specifically involved with bullying:

1.  Bullying with no physical injury (RB1)
2.  Cyberbullying (RB2)
3.  Bullying Behavior without physical injury that continues after intervention (BSC6)
4.  Cyberbullying that continues after intervention (BSC7)

## Hostile Environments
